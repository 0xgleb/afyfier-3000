## Afyfier 3000

(a picture of the team will be here)

## Problem

There are many financial documents but only one Afy.

## Solution

Create a digital version of Afy so that everyone can get help with their confusing documents.

## Remove jargon

The first thing we want to do is automatically remove jargon. Before we can remove jargon, we need to identify it.

## How to identify jargon?

As the first approximation, let's say that jargon is complex/uncommon words. We can train a neural network that will take a piece of text and identify which words are complex.

## How to replace jargon?

This is where BERT will help us.

## Who is BERT?

BERT was born at Google. I say born
